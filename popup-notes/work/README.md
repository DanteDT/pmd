## Popup notes work on these files

The (X)HTML syntax *works* but may *not conform* to any known standard like [EPUB 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/).

If it works *and* conforms to a published spec, the file belongs in [conform](../conform)

### Conventions

`OEBPS/content.opf` metadata confirms the OS and Software that pop up these notes, in entries like `<dc:subject>OS v, Software v</dc:subject>`

No examples at this time.
