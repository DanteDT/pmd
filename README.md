### Very brief overview
1. Scrape PMD TOC and Chapters
2. Basic HTML clean up, then some deep cleaning and patching to improve the e-reader experience
3. Prep the EPUB content, XHTML chapters
4. Build the EPUB

I test on readers that I have used for a long time, without trying harder for more common devices or apps : )
* Android tablet, with the reliable [Lithium epub reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faultexception.reader&hl=en-US).
* iPhone, with the spectacular [Readdle Documents](https://readdle.com/documents).
* Kobo Libra Color

### Contribute
Suggestions welcome to improve the epub experience, and to further clean up the content. Something not work on your reader? Please report it. 

Check the config.yaml, and set `debugging: True` to work on isolated modifications.

With respect and gratitude for Herman and Margaret. This is what I can offer.
